I am a Lyman Spitzer, Jr. Postdoctroal Fellow postdoc at the Department of
Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University. Combining theory and numerical
simulations, my researh focuses on understanding the dynamical evolution of
molecular clouds under the influence of stellar feedback. During my PhD, I
implemented a numerical algorithm for adaptive ray tracing that efficiently
solves the radiative transfer problem involving point sources. This has been
extensively used to study dispersal of star-forming molecular clouds by UV
radiation feedback and escape of radiation in diverse star-forming environments.
It has also been used to study the diffuse ionized gas in simulations of
galactic disks. 

<!-- Recently, I and my collaborators implemented a module for cooling -->
<!-- and heating that explicitly models realistic photochemical processes  -->
<!-- that are coupled with UV radiative transfer. Upon the completion of code -->
<!-- development, I ran a suite of radiation MHD simulations to study the -->
<!-- dependence of cloud dispersal on gravitational boundedness and magnetic -->
<!-- fields. I am also running simulations of multiphase, star- forming -->
<!-- galactic disks to understand how large-scale environments affect the -->
<!-- formation of molecular clouds. -->

I studied gravitational instability of a gaseous disk confined by an external
pressure, interfacial instability of evaporation fronts in the two-phase ISM,
wiggle instability of galactic spiral shocks, and instability of magnetized
ionization fronts surrounding HII regions. I received my PhD from Seoul National
University in 2018.
