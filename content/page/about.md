I am a first-year postdoc in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at
Princeton University. I received my PhD from Seoul National University in 2018.
My research focus is on theoretical and computational astrophysics in the areas
of star formation and interstellar medium (ISM). The primary goal of my research
is to understand how star clusters form, how UV radiation emitted by massive
stars affect the evolution of molecular clouds.

Previously I studied gravitational instability of a gaseous disk confined by an
external pressure, interfacial instability of evaporation fronts in the
two-phase ISM, wiggle instability of galactic spiral shocks, and instability of
magnetized ionization fronts surrounding HII regions.
